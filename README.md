# Stock Market Forecaster

This is a program that uses data science to predict the stock market from a ticker of your choice!

## How To Use

Currently I don't know if I will turn this into a python library or an api or an application
or just use it to win the stock market game.

But if you have your heart set on it
here is how you can use this.

### Step 1

Make sure you have python

### Step 2

Download the code from the repository

### Step 3

Run the app.py

### Disclaimers

I have not gotten around to adding a ui. So for now, 
enjoy some apple stock :)
